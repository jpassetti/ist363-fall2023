### Assignment(s)
1. End of class attendance: zip your IST363 project folder and submit it on Blackboard/Assignments.
2. Before next class: Create a Github repository for your IST363 semester folder and push your project to it. Submit the URL of your Github repository on Blackboard/Assignments.

### Github instructions
1. Install Git on your machine. Follow the instructions on Blackboard or [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Log in or create an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
3. Create a new repository called `ist363` (or something similar).
4. After the repository is created, Github gives you instructions on how to push your local project to the remote repository. Follow those instructions, but here's the gist:
    1. Open your IST363 project folder in VS Code
    2. Open the terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal)
    3. Run the command `git init`
    4. Run the command `git add .`
    5. Run the command `git commit -m "first commit"`
    6. Run the command `git branch -M master`
    7. Run the command `git remote add origin... (copy/paste this instruction from GitHub because it has the exact URL of your repository)`
    8. Run the command `git push -u origin master`
    9. Refresh the page on your Github repository and you should see your files there.
5. Copy/paste the URL of your Github repository and submit it on Blackboard/Assignments.
